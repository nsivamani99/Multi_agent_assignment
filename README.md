In this project, we designed a Multi-Agent Architecture system that generates AI/ML/GenAI use cases for a given company or industry. The system focuses on automating the process of market research, identifying industry-specific AI trends, and proposing relevant use cases that align with the company's strategic objectives. Additionally, the system collects resource assets such as relevant datasets and AI model links from platforms like Kaggle, HuggingFace, and GitHub, providing a comprehensive solution for organizations to leverage Generative AI and Machine Learning technologies.

The goal of the project was to create an intelligent and automated system that:

Researches the company/industry to understand its market segment, offerings, and strategic focus areas.

Generates use cases based on industry trends and AI/ML applications.

Collects relevant datasets and resources that can be used to implement the proposed solutions.

Outputs all this information in a structured, easy-to-read markdown format.

Methodology
The architecture of this system is based on three distinct agents, each tasked with a specific function. The agents interact with each other to deliver the final output. Below is a breakdown of each component:

1. Research Agent
Objective: This agent is responsible for conducting market research to understand the companyâ€™s industry, strategic focus, and product offerings.

Implementation: The agent uses web scraping techniques to gather industry data, company vision, and product information. It segments the company's position in the market (e.g., Retail, Finance, Healthcare, etc.) and identifies key offerings.

Example: For a company like Amazon, the agent might return information about Amazon's focus on e-commerce, logistics, and its use of AI for inventory management.

2. Use Case Generation Agent
Objective: Based on the information collected by the Research Agent, this agent generates AI/ML use cases tailored to the company or industry.

Implementation: The agent analyzes industry standards and trends related to AI, ML, and automation. It proposes relevant use cases that can enhance operational efficiency, improve customer experience, and drive business innovation. It uses industry reports (e.g., McKinsey, Deloitte) and AI application research to generate ideas.

Example: In the retail sector, use cases like "AI-powered recommendation engines" and "chatbots for customer support" could be generated.

3. Resource Collection Agent
Objective: The Resource Agent is responsible for collecting relevant datasets and AI model resources to implement the generated use cases.

Implementation: The agent searches open-source platforms like Kaggle, HuggingFace, and GitHub for datasets and repositories related to the identified use cases. The links are stored and organized for easy access.

Example: For the use case "Personalized Product Recommendations", the agent would collect datasets like those from Kaggle's retail-recommendation dataset.

Data Flow:
The Research Agent starts by researching the company/industry, followed by passing the findings to the Use Case Generation Agent, which then generates AI-driven use cases. Finally, the Resource Collection Agent gathers relevant datasets to support the implementation of these use cases.

All results are stored in a markdown file for easy viewing.
